# getjv.io website

## ðŸ”– Project

getjv.github.io is a copy my [official homepage]. There I handled to aggregate all my contact information and I use several API calls to index my portfolio jobs, git issues, git pull requests, StackOverflow posts, and articles from dev.to. I expect this website to offer more visibility to my work and become the recruiter's life easier.
